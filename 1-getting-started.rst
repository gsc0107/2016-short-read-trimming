Once you're at the console, go to New... Terminal... and copy/paste
this text into it::

  echo hello, world

If it doesn't work, could you `e-mail me <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__
with your browser and OS version, please?

If copy/paste doesn't work for you, you can do the following:

* open a new file in the editor, and name it 'commands.sh';
* copy/paste stuff into commands.sh, clearing it each time;
* to execute the commands, run::

    . commands.sh

Next: :doc:`2-background`
